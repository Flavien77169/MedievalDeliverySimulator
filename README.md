# Medieval Delivery Simulator project

**Hello !**

This is the actual repository for the executable version of our game : Medieval Delivery Simulator

I've made this game in collaboration with :
- [Skyclem19](https://github.com/Skyclem19) (map designer)
- [Flavien77169](https://github.com/Flavien77169) (sound and menu designer)
- [InsertNamee](https://github.com/InsertNamee) (vehicles maker)

How to play it ?
- Download the Zip and extract it in another new folder.
- Go in **MDS** folder.
- Then launch (**WITHOUT MOVING IT**) the "Brocéliande.exe" file (yes, the name changed during dev) and Enjoy !
- OR, you have an **online version playable on any browser** with less performance [here](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/build-k7o-1) (with unity play).

Controls ?
- Mouse and Keyboard :

  - Navigation through menus :
    - Click on buttons with mouse or arrows.
    - Ingame :
      - ESCAPE to enable Ingame menu
      - TAB to enable to a large map
  
  - You can **move** with :
    - Z : go Forward
    - Q : steer Left
    - S : brake then go Backward
    - D : steer Right

  - SPACE : to **brake** the hind wheels, not as S does (yes the game can be quite fast)

  - In case your stuck :
    - If turned turtle / overbalanced -> use R

- Controller (based on xbox controller buttons):

  - Navigation through menus :
    - Move with pad ✙
    - Accept with your accept button (normally **A** button)
    - Go back by using BACK menu buttons
    - Ingame :
      - Option button (☰) to enable Ingame menu
      - Capture button (☐) to enable to a large map 

  - You can **move** with :
    - Your joystick only (yes it's peculiar)
      - Up to accelerate
      - Down to decelerate
      - Right or Left to steer

  - RB trigger : to **brake** the hind wheels, not as joystick down does (yes the game can be quite fast)

  - In case your stuck :
    - If turned turtle / overbalanced -> use X button (not the xbox logo button)

P.S. :
- If the game is too loud you can modify the volume level in game settings.
- This game was made as a 1 week project at our school (89 school).

**This game was made as a school project so we consequently used some free or not free asset of unity store (except for the *caleche* that is original and animated !!!), and was, from the start, not created to be lucrative stuff**
